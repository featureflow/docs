## Available Integrations

Featureflow currently supports the following integrations:

- **[Slack](/docs/slack)** — Connect your Slack workspace to receive notifications about feature flag changes and updates.
- **[Jira](/docs/jira)** — Connect your Jira instance to sync issues and updates, linking feature flags directly to your project management workflow.

You can also integrate Featureflow with **[Heap Analytics](/docs/heap)** to track feature flag evaluations alongside your user analytics.

To add an integration, click the **Add** button next to the desired service. You will be redirected to the respective application (Slack or Atlassian Marketplace) to complete the authorization and setup process.
