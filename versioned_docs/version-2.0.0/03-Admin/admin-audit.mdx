# Admin Audit

The Audit tab provides a comprehensive log of all recent changes across your projects and features. This allows you to track who made changes, what was changed, and when it happened.

Each audit entry displays:
- **Action type** — indicated by an icon (+ for creates, trash for deletes, pencil for updates)
- **User** — the team member who performed the action
- **Description** — details of what was changed, with links to the relevant project, feature, or environment
- **Timestamp** — both relative time (e.g., "3 hours ago") and the exact date and time

The audit log tracks actions such as:
- Creating and deleting projects
- Creating and modifying features
- Creating and updating environments
- Enabling or disabling features
- Team member changes
