# Admin Projects

The Projects tab allows you to manage your projects and their environments. A project typically represents a single application, and each project can have multiple environments (e.g., Production, Test, Staging).

## Project Details

The project view displays:
- **Project Name** — the display name of the project
- **Project Key** — a unique identifier used in URLs and API calls
- **Created** — when the project was created
- **Last Modified** — when the project was last updated
- **Features** — the number of feature flags in the project

Use the **Change** dropdown to switch between projects.

## Creating a Project

Click **+ New Project** to create a new project.

Enter a **Project Name** (display name) and a **Project Key** (unique identifier). The project key is used in URLs and API calls and cannot be changed after creation.

## Updating a Project

Click **Update Project** to rename the project.

## Environments

Each project contains one or more environments. Environments allow you to manage feature flags separately across different stages of your application (e.g., development, staging, production).

The environments table shows:
- **Environment** — name and key
- **URL** — optional URL where the environment is hosted
- **Type** — Production or Development
- **Created** — when the environment was created
- **Actions** — view API keys, edit, or delete

### Creating an Environment

Click **+ New Environment** to add a new environment to your project.

![Create New Environment](/img/2-0/admin-project-create-new-environment.png)

Configure the following:
- **Environment Name** — display name for the environment
- **Environment Key** — unique identifier (alphanumeric, hyphens, and underscores only)
- **Environment URL** — optional URL where this environment is deployed
- **Environment Color** — choose a color to easily identify the environment
- **Production Environment** — toggle on for production environments (may have additional restrictions)

### Updating an Environment

Click the edit icon in the Actions column to update an environment's settings.

### Viewing API Keys

Click the key icon in the Actions column to view the API keys for an environment.

![API Keys](/img/2-0/admin-project-environment-api-keys.png)

Each environment has two API keys:
- **Client SDK API Key** — use this key in client-side SDKs (JavaScript, React, mobile apps)
- **Server SDK API Key** — use this key in server-side SDKs (Node.js, Java, Python, etc.)

Click the copy button to copy a key to your clipboard.

### Deleting an Environment

Click the delete icon in the Actions column to remove an environment. This action cannot be undone and will permanently delete all environment data and configurations.
