# Targeting Features

Targeting lets you control which users see which variants based on user attributes. You can target by any attribute you pass from your application — user role, subscription tier, region, signup date, and more.

## How Targeting Works

When evaluating a feature, you pass a user object containing a unique ID and any attributes. Featureflow evaluates rules from top to bottom and returns the variant for the first matching rule.

## The Failover Rule

Every feature has a failover rule — the catch-all "else" rule at the bottom. If no other rules match, users receive the variant defined in this rule.

## Creating Rules

1. Click **Add Rule** — a new rule panel appears above the failover rule
2. Select a **target attribute** (e.g., `tier`, `user_role`, `country`)
3. Choose a **comparator** — options vary by data type (text, number, or date)
4. Enter the **value(s)** to match against
5. Select the **variant** or **split** to return when the rule matches
6. Click **Save Targeting**

### Multiple Conditions

Use the **+** and **-** buttons to add multiple conditions to a rule. All conditions within a rule are evaluated with AND logic — all must match for the variant to be returned.

### Rule Order

Rules are evaluated top to bottom. The first matching rule wins. Drag rules to reorder them.

## Passing User Attributes

To use targeting, pass user attributes when evaluating features in your application:

```js title="JavaScript"
var user = {
  id: 'user-123',
  attributes: {
    name: 'john',
    tier: 'gold',
    user_role: 'pvt_tester'
  }
}
```

```java title="Java"
FeatureFlowUser user = new FeatureflowUser(userId)
    .withAttribute("user_role", "pvt_tester")
    .withAttribute("tier", "gold")
    .withAttribute("tenure_years", 10)
    .withAttribute("signup_date", new DateTime());
```

The attributes you pass become available as targeting options in the dashboard.
