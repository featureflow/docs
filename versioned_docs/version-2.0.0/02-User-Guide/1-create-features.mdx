# Create Features
This page describes how to create a feature in the featureflow dashboard

Within the [projects page](https://beta.featureflow-staging.com/projects/proj1), click the "+ New Feature" button

![New Feature Button](/img/2-0/feature-new-feature-button.png)

Enter a unique key, name and description.

The unique key is used to identify the feature in your application and cannot be changed once it is set. It should be a single word with no special characters- we suggest lower-case-hyphenated.

![New Feature Modal](/img/2-0/feature-create-new-modal.png)

The default, and most basic, setup has two variants. 'off' and 'on'. When the feature is enabled then all users will see the 'on' variant. When the feature is disabled then all users will see the 'off' variant.

You can modify and change the variants, as you develop more advanced scenarios and additional feature variants you may come back and modify these to suit.

Click Save. Your feature has been created.

#### What's next?
Now you'll want to go and enable and disable your feature in your environments
