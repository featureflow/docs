## Feature Details

Enter the following information:

- **Key** — A unique identifier for the feature (e.g., `new-checkout-flow`). This is used in your code and cannot be changed after creation. Use lowercase letters with hyphens.
- **Name** — A human-readable name for the feature.
- **Description** — Optional details about what this feature does.

## Variants

By default, features are created with two variants:
- **off** — Returned when the feature is disabled
- **on** — Returned when the feature is enabled

You can customise these variants or add more to support advanced use cases like A/B testing or multi-variate features.
