# Gradual Rollouts

Gradual rollouts let you release features to a percentage of users, reducing risk by incrementally increasing exposure. Users are consistently assigned to the same variant based on their unique identifier, ensuring a stable experience.

## Setting Up a Gradual Rollout

1. Navigate to your feature and select the **Targeting** tab
2. In the rule's variant selector, choose **Split**
3. Use the slider to set the percentage for each variant
4. Click **Save Targeting**

If your feature has more than two variants, additional sliders will appear allowing you to distribute percentages across all variants.

## Combining with Targeting Rules

You can combine gradual rollouts with [targeting rules](/docs/targeting-features) to create advanced scenarios, such as:
- Rolling out to 10% of users in a specific region
- Gradually increasing exposure for premium tier users
- Testing variants only for users who signed up after a certain date

## Next Steps

- [Targeting features](/docs/targeting-features) — control which users see which variants
