# Managing Feature Variants

Variants allow a feature to return different values beyond simple on/off states. Use variants for:
- **Version testing** — e.g., `v1`, `v2`, `v3`
- **A/B testing** — e.g., `control`, `variant-a`, `variant-b`
- **Feature modes** — e.g., `normal`, `maintenance`, `advanced`

## Adding Variants

1. Navigate to your project and select a feature
2. Select the **Settings** tab
3. Click **Change Variants** to expand the variants section
4. Click **Add Variant** to create a new variant
5. Enter the variant details:
   - **Key** — unique identifier used in your code (e.g., `variant-b`)
   - **Name** — human-readable display name
   - **Description** — optional details about this variant
6. Click **Save Feature Settings**

Once you've defined your variants, you can assign them to users through [targeting rules](/targeting-features) or [gradual rollouts](/gradual-rollouts).

:::caution
**Variants are shared across all environments**

Modifying or removing a variant affects all environments. If a variant in use is removed, the environment will fall back to the default variant. Featureflow provides safeguards to warn you before modifying variants that are currently in use.

## Defining Variants in Code

You can also define variants directly in your application code. When you register a feature with predefined variants, Featureflow will automatically make them available in the dashboard.

## Next Steps

- [Gradual rollouts](/gradual-rollouts) — release variants to a percentage of users
- [Targeting features](/targeting-features) — assign variants to specific users or segments
