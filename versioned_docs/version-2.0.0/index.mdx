# Overview

Featureflow is a feature management platform that helps you safely release, control, and test features in your applications. Use feature flags to separate deployment from release, run A/B tests, and progressively roll out new functionality.

## Key Concepts

### Organisation

Your organisation is the top-level account that owns all projects, environments, and team members.

### Project

A project represents a single application or product. You might have a backend API, a web app, and a mobile app all managed under one project.

### Environment

Each project has multiple environments (e.g., Development, Staging, Production). Each environment has its own SDK keys and independent feature configurations, allowing you to test features before releasing to production.

### Feature

A feature is a flag you control through Featureflow. Each feature has a unique key used in your code and can be configured differently per environment.

### Feature Control

A feature control is the per-environment configuration for a feature — the rules and variants that determine what users see.

### Variant

When a feature is evaluated, it returns a variant. The simplest features have two variants (`on` and `off`), but you can define any number of variants for more complex scenarios like A/B testing (`control`, `variant-a`, `variant-b`) or versioning (`v1`, `v2`).

### User

When evaluating a feature, you pass a user object with a unique ID and attributes (e.g., `tier`, `country`, `signup_date`). These attributes power [targeting rules](/targeting-features) to control which users see which variants.

## Architecture

Featureflow delivers feature configurations through a globally distributed, highly available CDN.

### Server SDKs

Server SDKs download and cache feature rules locally. Evaluations happen instantly in-memory — often faster than a database lookup. Rule changes are pushed to SDKs in real-time.

### Client SDKs

Client SDKs (JavaScript, React, mobile) call Featureflow's CDN to evaluate features. This keeps your client bundles small and ensures users always get the latest configuration.

### Events

Both server and client SDKs send usage events to Featureflow, powering the analytics dashboard to show feature status and usage across your application.
