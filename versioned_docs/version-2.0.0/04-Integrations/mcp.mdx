# MCP Server Integration

Integrate Featureflow with AI assistants like Claude, Cursor, and other MCP-compatible tools. The Featureflow MCP server enables AI assistants to manage your feature flags, projects, environments, and more through natural language.

GitHub: https://github.com/featureflow/featureflow-mcp

## What is MCP?

[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) is an open standard that allows AI assistants to interact with external tools and services. With the Featureflow MCP server, you can ask your AI assistant to:

- List and search feature flags
- Create, update, and delete features
- Enable or disable features in specific environments
- Manage projects and environments
- View targeting rules and API keys

## Quick Start

### 1. Create a Personal Access Token

1. Log into Featureflow as an administrator
2. Navigate to **Administration** → **API Tokens**
3. Click **Create Token** and copy the token (starts with `api-`)

### 2. Configure in Cursor

Add to your `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "featureflow": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "featureflow-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "FEATUREFLOW_API_TOKEN": "api-your-token-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Restart Cursor

Press `Cmd+Shift+P` → "MCP: Restart Servers" or restart Cursor.

That's it! You can now ask Claude to manage your feature flags.

## Example Usage

Once configured, you can ask your AI assistant things like:

- "Create a feature called 'new-checkout' in the 'webapp' project"
- "Enable the 'dark-mode' feature in production"
- "What features are currently enabled in staging?"
- "Disable 'beta-feature' in all environments"
- "Show me the targeting rules for 'premium-feature'"
- "Clone 'existing-feature' to 'new-feature-v2'"

## Troubleshooting

### MCP Server Not Connecting

1. Verify your API token is correct and starts with `api-`
2. Ensure the token has the correct permissions
3. Check that `npx` is available in your PATH
4. Restart your AI assistant after configuration changes

### Permission Errors

The API token must have sufficient permissions for the operations you're requesting. Contact your Featureflow administrator if you need elevated access.
