# Experiments
You can compare the success of variants in featureflow using Experimental A/B testing.

:::note
Experiments are only available for enterprise plans.
:::

You may create experiments to test the effect of a new feature variant. Featureflow will determine which variant is the winner given a defined goal.

#### 1. Define a goal.
A goal is any event that you wish to track. For example a payment or signup submit button.
Using the javascript api simple add the following:

```js title="Javascript"
featureflow.goal('goal-button-clicked');
```

#### 2. Configure your feature experiment cohorts

Using feature targeting rules define the cohorts that will be sent to each variant. This may be a simple 50/50 split or more advanced such as sending only a subset to the experiment variants. In your project environment, click 'Update Rules' for your desired feature and set the cohort rules.
In the example below we have set a 50/50 split for all users who have the 'ab_cohort' attribute. Everyone else will see the 'off variant'.

The more traffic you send to a variant, the quicker your experiment can derive a meaningful conclusion, of course you may want to balance this to a trusted or beta set of users.

#### 3. Create an experiment
An experiment links a given feature to your desired goal. Under the Experiments menu, click 'New Experiment

![Create an experiment](/img/create-experiment.png)

Set an experiment name, description, goal key, feature and desired variants.

#### 4. Enable the experiment
Simply toggle the experiment on.

#### 5. View your experiment statistics
Experiments will log impressions and goal conversions. When we reach a 95% confidence level with over 1000 samples we can declare a winner.
