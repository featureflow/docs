# Gradual rollouts
You can rollout new features gradually using the variant split function. The variant split function uses your users unique identifier and assigns them to a variant based on the set percentage.

1. Select the feature you wish to edit
In the feature detail view, click the 'Targeting' tab.

3. Select the percentage using the slider.
If you have more than two variants then additional sliders will allow you to apportion a percentage to them

4. Click 'Save Targeting' to save

Using Targeting rules you can create more advanced scenarios such as rollout to a particular split given some specific rules (such as a date, geographical region or user type).
