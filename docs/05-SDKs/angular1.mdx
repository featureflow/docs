Firstly, Get your Featureflow account at [featureflow.io](http://www.featureflow.io)

We have a very simple ng-featureflow provider which you may use in in your angular application:

You can see a running example in codepan:

## 1. Install dependencies
via CDN

```bash
<script crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://cdn.featureflow.io/featureflow.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.featureflow.io/v1.3.3/featureflow-ng.js"></script>
```


via bower:

```bash
bower install featureflow-ng
```
via npm
```bash
npm install --save featureflow-ng
```

## 2. Register the module

```javascript
angular.module('myApp', [
...
'ng-featureflow'
...
```
## 3. Initialise in angular.config
Obtain your 'JavaScript Environment Api Key' or 'JavaScript Project Api Key' from the Api Keys link in the top right of the environment admin page and pass it to the .init funtion


:::note
### ðŸ“˜What's the difference between Keys?

The 'JavaScript Environment Api Key' is specific to an environment - we recommend you use this key in your production environment.

The 'JavaScript Project Api Key' is common across all environments - you can then use the 'Url' value in the environment settings to match your environment by its Url. You may use a wildcard - for example '.test.mysite.com' may match your 'TEST' environment.
:::

```javascript
app.config(function (featureflowProvider) {
    var FF_API_KEY = 'js-env-xxxxxxxxx';
    featureflowProvider.init(FF_API_KEY, {});
}
```
## 4. Expose and evaluate in an ng-if statement
```javascript
app.controller('MyController', function($scope, featureflow) {
$scope.featureflow = featureflow;
// or e.g:
//vm.featureflow. = featureflow;
...
```
```html
<div class="col-md-7" ng-if="featureflow.evaluate('example-feature').is('on')">
    <div style="position: relative;">
        ITS ON!
    </div>
</div>
```
## 5. Update the featureflowUser on login

```javascript
var acc = {//loaded from login
    roles: ['admin','manager'],
    firstName: 'John',
    lastName: 'Smith',
    company: 'Acme Org',
    emails: ['a@b.com','d@d.com']
    state: 'NSW'
    admin: true
}

if(loggedIn && acc){ //if logged in then update
        var user = {
            id: acc.accountId,
            attributes: {
                role: acc.roles,
                name: acc.firstName + " " + acc.lastName,
                company: acc.company,
                email: acc.emails,
                state: acc.state
            }
        };
    featureflow.updateUser(user);
}
```
